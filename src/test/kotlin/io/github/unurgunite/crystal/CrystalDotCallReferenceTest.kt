/**
 * Tests for [CrystalDotCallReference] — the PsiReference that powers identifier
 * highlighting and hover/Ctrl+B for DOT-call method names
 * (`Apfel.tanzen`, `a.essen`, `Senf.new`).
 *
 * Resolution rules covered:
 * - CONSTANT receiver → exact lookup via `CrystalMethodByClassIndex`.
 * - IDENTIFIER receiver with inferred type → exact lookup on the inferred class.
 * - IDENTIFIER receiver with **unknown** type → resolves by method name within the
 *   PROJECT ONLY (never the stdlib) via a name-only fallback, so local navigation
 *   works (`rule.auto_fixable?`) without the cross-project false positives the
 *   strict design otherwise forbids. The old `GotoDeclarationHandler` fell back to
 *   `CrystalDefinitionFinder.findDefinitions(name, project)` project-wide.
 * - `.new` constructor → returns null here (the dedicated constructor path in
 *   `CrystalGotoDeclarationHandler` and `CrystalDocumentationProvider` handles it).
